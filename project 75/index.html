        <p class="text-muted">the church was surrounded by trees, which gave it a calming and peaceful sensation, the building was long with a triangular shaped form, with burgundy bricks surroundings and a bit of white in the front entrance and some at the very top and sides with a dark beige roofing to give the church some color, the windows seemed to be a tinted crystal glass that was designed with blues and a beige color. As I made my way into the church their was an entry room where a man and a women and what seemed to be their two children greeted me and handed me a pamphlet that described what was going to take place in that days Sunday school and mass, then I made my way to another pair of doors where I could hear the choir singing, as I opened the doors the inside of the church was a tan wood looking color all around  and had matching tan benches with burgundy red bedding to match the carpet, the thing that stood out most  to me when I walked in was the large cross that was in the very front that shined very bright as if the sun was hitting it to give the whole church light</p>

    <p>This year the Interschool Debate Competition was held at our school. There were 24 different schools participating. The competition was held for a week. Food and accommodation were arranged at our school hostel. All the participants were extraordinarily skilled.

      One could actually see the future leaders in the contestants. The decisions of the judges were final. There were no foul plays. This year our school won the first prize and much to our amazement two of the best speakers were from our school.
      
      All the participants were students with equal calibre and potential but in the end, some stood out shining brighter than the others. The topic for the final competition was ” the increasing number of old age homes in India “. There were so many notable points presented by each team but the point presented by the winning team was the game-changer.
      
      The prizes were given away by the honourable education minister, who talked about a few memories from his school days.</p>

    <p>A football match is quite exciting to watch. It is even more exciting to play in one. Recently our school organized a football match between two schools. It was great fun to watch. The football match was played in our school ground yesterday. It was between the school team and the university team. Our school team lost the match by 2 goals.

      It was a very exciting match. Both the teams played very well. The school team scored the first goal in the first half. But in the second half, the university team scored two goals and won the match. The school team played very well and fought hard till the end. They were unlucky to lose the match. The university team was a bit stronger and played better in the second half.
      
      The most amazing moments of the match were when our school team scored the first goal and when the university team scored the winning goals. It was a great match to watch. I suppose, the school team could have won the match. They played very well and were unlucky to lose. If they had scored more goals in the first half, they would have won the match.</p>

    <p>On the eve of the birthday of Vikram Sarabhai, (August 12, 2021), the Father of the Indian Space Programme, the Science and Research Forum of New Delhi organised an inter-school science exhibition. Candidates from different schools participated in this science exhibition. The Forum announced that the two best exhibits would be kept in the Hall of Exhibits where it will be displayed to the public. Models related to space satellites, different satellites of the planets, the various galaxies, the working of the Hadron Collider and many more things were on display. The members of the Science and Research Forum were impressed by the efforts of the students. The members of the committee had a tough time deciding which two best exhibits they were going to present in the Hall of Exhibits. Every one of the participants was given certificates and mementoes from the Science and Research Forum of New Delhi.</p>

    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The canteen is very big and could accommodate many students at a time. We have a coupon system, where the students who would like to have food from the canteen, would require buying coupon for the desired item from the counter during the first short recess of the day in school.

Then, during the lunch hour, the students assemble in the canteen and they provide their coupons. Based on the coupons, the students would be given the food that they have placed their orders for. The students needs to sit in the canteen and have the food and return back the plates. The canteen at our school would almost be full on all days. Many students come there to have their food.

Our canteen provides all kinds of food. You would get the vegetarian food and the non-vegetarian food. You have the rice varieties which may include the normal meals or fried rice and also fast food kind of items which includes sandwiches, rolls, wraps, burgers etc.

Even soft drinks and packet juices are provided. You just need to choose which food you would like to have and pay accordingly. The canteen food is very tasty and it is very neat. The food is all sealed and served in packets, so that it makes it easy to carry around and have food. There is a canteen in-charge that takes care of the quality of the food and the neatness of the canteen.

The cooks of the canteen are very nice and they make sure that we students get the best food. Since the canteen functions very well, most of the students prefer to have food from here and the canteen would be full almost on all working days.

Even on special occasions or get together, the canteen provides food for the students and staff participating in the occasion or get together. It is really great to have a canteen in the premises of the school and to get good and tasty food, when we want.</p>

    <h4>Implemented online attendance managment system</h4>
    <img src="attendance.jpg" class="img-responsive col-lg-5 col-md-5 col-sm-5 col-xs-12">

      What Are The Types Of Attendance Management System?
There are various methods of automating the attendance process and schools can choose a system that suits their requirements the best.

Here are the best ways to automate student attendance in schools...
<br>
1: RFID Attendance Management System
The most popular technology in automating attendance is Radio Frequency Identification (RFID).

This student attendance management system uses the following simple mechanism and marks attendance of the entire class within seconds:

Each student is given a smart RFID card having a unique identification number.
The RFID can be installed at the entrance of the school, classroom, library or any other important location.
Students carrying their smart cards simply have to pass through the reader and the reader scans their unique identification number and hence the attendance is marked automatically.
Since the RFID reader is capable of reading several cards at once, the attendance of multiple students is marked simultaneously.
The data from the RFID reader is automatically fetched by the integrated school ERP software. Hence, the schools get the access to student attendance details of every class and section at once.
<br>
2: Biometric Attendance Management System
Another useful electronic attendance system for students that saves efforts, as well as time, is - the biometric system. It works in the following way:

The fingerprint of each student is saved in the biometric system which is integrated with an educational ERP system.
The students simply need to place their finger on the biometric and upon verification with the original fingerprint input stored in the system, their attendance is marked.
Since a biometric system works on fingerprints, which are unique for every individual, there are lesser chances of false or proxy attendance. This makes the biometric system quite accurate and a highly reliable attendance management system.
Just like the RFID system, the student data from the biometric is also fetched by the educational ERP and hence can be accessed, viewed, and managed by the concerned authorities in real-time.

3: School App Attendance Management System
School mobile apps not just provide seamless communication between parents and teachers, but can also help in managing student attendance.

Integrating a school app in educational ERP software is a great way to reduce a teacher’s hassles because of the following three major reasons.

Firstly, a teacher can mark attendance in less than a minute with an effective school management app.
Secondly, it enables parents to directly send in the leave applications of their kids via the school app. The students who are on leave appear as ‘on-leave’ in the app while marking attendance, and the teacher does not have to think twice about that student status. This largely reduces a teacher’s time and efforts.
Thirdly, an auto-triggered message or app push notification can be sent via the school transportation app to inform parents about their child’s whereabouts while traveling. This further ensures student security & safety.
<br>
3 Key Advantages Of Attendance Management System
User-Friendly: The user interface is very simple. Data storage and recovery is fast and secure. Additionally, graphic reports are available which makes interpretation of data simple and easy to grasp.
Quick Report Generation: Various reports such as Student-wise attendance, Day-wise attendance, Class-wise attendance, Month-Wise, Class-Attendance, and much more. can be easily generated quickly. Current and back-dated reports are available readily.
Zero Errors: Reduction of paperwork and elimination of errors is possible when attendance is automated.
